The most popular rollup technique, namely optimistic rollup, is not suitable for our use case. This is because while transaction execution is offloaded to L2, all these L2 transactions are still submitted to L1 as a record. Another popular rollup called zero-knowledge (ZK) rollup solves this problem. But ZK computation is slow, and the type of use cases it can currently support is very limited (such as token transfers), which cannot fulfill the diverse business needs of XDC\'s enterprise and institutional customers.'),(0,i.kt)("p",null,"On the other hand, subnet is a perfect solution. By subnet, the customer runs a blockchain and checkpoints its critical consensus data to the parent chain. This way, not only is privacy preserved, the subnet can have its own security and resiliency besides those provided by the parent chain. This is particularly useful to enterprise and institutional customers who may collaborate with untrusted partners.
