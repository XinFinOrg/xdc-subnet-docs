## Algorithms and Rules

- **Packet Validation:** Ensures that only approved applications on registered chains can send packets. The contract validates each transactionâ€™s authenticity by verifying proofs of transaction and receipt.
- **Failure Data Handling:** If a packet transmission fails, the contract records it, allowing for potential retries or analysis.
- **Chain Registration:** Only authorized users (contract owner) can register new chains, safeguarding against unauthorized cross-chain communication.
