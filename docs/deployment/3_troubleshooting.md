# Common Issues and Troubleshooting

## Common Issues 
  - Subnet blocks are not being mined.
    1. First confirm that the Subnet nodes are able to communicate with each other through the network layer. Run the check peer script `generated/scripts/check-peers.sh` the number of peers should be one less than number of subnet nodes. For example, if there are 3 Subnet nodes in total, each node should have 2 peers.

    2. If the nodes are peering but still not mining, it could be a low memory issue. In Docker configs you can try to increase memory or swap. Then, in case of fresh Subnet, [delete data and start the nodes again](./1_launch_subnet.md/#deleting-subnet). ![Docker Memory Config](./img/docker_mem.png)

    3. Docker engine in Mac OS can be inconsistent after long-running or high-load. It could help to restart the machine and [hard reset the subnet](./1_launch_subnet.md#deleting-subnet ) to get it running.

  - Subnet node does not boot with error log `Fatal: Error starting protocol stack: listen unix /work/xdcchain/XDC.ipc: bind: invalid argument`

  This is due to the volume mount path being too long. The mounth path is your current directory (also can check with `pwd` command). Please move the `generated` folder to a shorter path and try again.

  - Docker image startup fails with `SIGKILL` or `Error code: 137` found in logs. (Issue found in Frontend image)

  This error occurs because Docker ran Out Of Memory (OOM). You can increase the memory limit in [Docker settings](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/settings/mac/#:~:text=lower%20the%20number.-,Memory,-.%20By%20default%2C%20Docker)

   


## Troubleshooting Scripts
  - `generated/scripts/check-mining.sh`

  This will check your current block in Subnet

  - `generated/scripts/check-peers.sh`
  
  This will check the number of peers of your Subnet node
